#FelonyDiscrimination.org

##Problem:

Discrimination against persons with felony records is openly allowed by legislation. The result is unemployment, homelessness, higher ricidivism rates, and wasted tax money.

##Solution:

This app is going to provide a valuable resource to those unprotected souls in the form of a searchable database that lists out “friendly” and “unfriendly” estabilishments in order to assist them in finding organizations that will house and employ them. Furthermore, this database will be used to collect the data needed to seek amendments to current legislation.
